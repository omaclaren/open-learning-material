# Open learning material
Some teaching material and other educational resources.

Like all such material much of it is either shamelessly (or shamefully!) plagiarized, borrowed, edited etc from other sources, especially courses I've taken before or notes I've inherited from past lecturers. I will try to add some credits as I go. This is essentially impossible for some material, however, as it was effectively picked up from the aether.

If you have any objections to me making this material (or some parts of it) available then let me know. My intention is simply to make it available for anyone who wants to learn about these topics.
